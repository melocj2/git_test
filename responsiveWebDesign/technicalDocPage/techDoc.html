      <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>Javascript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-side Javascript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
        <li>Server-side Javascript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running Javascript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <p>To get started writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello" + yourName); }<br>
      greetMe("World");</code>
      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>You use variables as a symbolic name for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($); subsequest characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü as identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
      <code>var x = 42;</code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
      <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
      <code>x = 42;</code>
      <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
      <p>With the keyword let. For example, </p>
      <code>let y = 13;</code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <ul>
        <li>Six data types that are primitives: 
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false</li>
            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
      <header>Variable Scope</header>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, becuase it is available only within the function.</p>
      <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block. which in this case is an if statement.</p>
      <code>if (true) { var = 5; } console.log(x); //5</code>
      <p>This behavior changes when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
      <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); //ReferenceError: y is not defined. </code>
