    <h3>Who was Aaron Swartz?</h3>
    <p>Aaron Swartz was a prolific computer programmer and hacker who worked on co-authoring several projects. The most accessible "hit" of all of his creations was probably "reddit.com". He held very strong beliefs about the way information should be accessed on the internet. He believed in an open internet, where information should be available to all. One of his primary convictions was that academic journals should be easily accessible without charge, on the internet. His premise was that information generated by universities today is highly segregated and available only to a select few, leading to fewer opportunities for everyone else. It was and is the case that universities tend to keep their data under close guard, often charging fees for access to the information contained in academic journals. Even the students and professors of universities, who have the ability to search vast libraries of journal articles, are often forced to pay for content published by their colleagues. Aaron believed that making the results of academic studies free and open on the internet would help to ameliorate the effects of data segregation, and help perpetuate a more egalitarian solciety. After stealing data from MIT, he was caught by police and faced 35 years in prison. Sadly, he ended up taking his own life before he was incarcerated.</p>
